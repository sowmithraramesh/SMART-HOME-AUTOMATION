# Home Automation with Arduino IoT Cloud using ESP32

This repository contains a project for implementing **Home Automation** using the **Arduino IoT Cloud** and an ESP32 microcontroller. The project allows you to control multiple home appliances such as lights, fans, or other devices remotely via the Arduino IoT Cloud Dashboard, accessible on both mobile and desktop platforms.



## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a smart home automation system using the **Arduino IoT Cloud**. With this system, you can control devices in real time from anywhere through a simple user interface.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time control** of multiple home appliances.
- **Dashboard monitoring** via Arduino IoT Cloud.
- Remote access using **WiFi** and ESP32.
- Simple and customizable dashboard interface.



## Materials Required

- **ESP32 WiFi Module**
- **4-Channel Relay Module**
- **Bulbs** (for demonstration purposes)
- **9V DC Adapter**
- **7805 Voltage Regulator IC**
- **Connecting Wires**
- **Breadboard**


## Circuit Diagram and Hardware Setup

### GPIO Configuration:
The ESP32 GPIO pins used in this project are:
- **GPIO19**: Connected to Relay Channel 1
- **GPIO21**: Connected to Relay Channel 2
- **GPIO22**: Connected to Relay Channel 3
- **GPIO23**: Connected to Relay Channel 4

### Power Supply:
- Use a **9V DC Adapter** to power the circuit.
- The **7805 Voltage Regulator IC** ensures a 5V output to power the ESP32 module.

The output of the relays is connected to bulbs for testing and demonstration purposes.



## Setting Up Arduino IoT Cloud Dashboard

Follow these steps to configure your Arduino IoT Cloud Dashboard:

1. **Create a Thing**:
   - Go to the Arduino IoT Cloud interface and create a new Thing.
   - Add variables for each device (e.g., Light1, Light2, etc.).

      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a282672-fb79-4185-9b95-9093d2cad852)

   - Set each variable type to `bool` for ON/OFF control.

2. **Set Up Network Credentials**:
   - Input your **SSID** (WiFi name), **Password**, and the **Secret Key** generated in the Arduino IoT Cloud settings.

3. **Build the Dashboard**:
   - Add switches to the dashboard using the `Edit` option.
   - Link each switch to a corresponding variable (e.g., Light1, Light2).
   - Arrange and resize widgets as desired.



## Source Code

The source code (`Home_Automation.ino`) for this project connects the ESP32 to the Arduino IoT Cloud and controls the relays. Below is the main code snippet:

```cpp
#include "thingProperties.h"

int pinnumber = 2;

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial and wait for port to open:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(pinnumber, OUTPUT);
  delay(1500);

  // Initialize properties and connect to IoT Cloud
  initProperties();
  ArduinoCloud.begin(ArduinoIoTPreferredConnection);

  // Debugging
  setDebugMessageLevel(2);
  ArduinoCloud.printDebugInfo();
}

void loop() {
  ArduinoCloud.update();
  // Your custom code can go here
}

/*
  This function is executed whenever the value of a READ_WRITE variable
  (like "Led") is updated from the IoT Cloud Dashboard.
*/
void onLedChange() {
  // Code to execute when the variable changes
}
```

The `thingProperties.h` file is automatically generated by Arduino IoT Cloud during setup. Make sure this file is included in your project.




## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Home-Automation-Arduino-IoT-Cloud.git
   ```
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Install the necessary libraries:
   - `ArduinoIoTCloud`
   - `WiFi`
4. Update the network credentials and secret keys in the `thingProperties.h` file.
5. Upload the code to the ESP32 board.
6. Open the Arduino IoT Cloud Dashboard to control your devices in real time.


## Applications
